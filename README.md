## ðŸ§  About Me

My name is Tharuksha Aaron Don, a Computer Science major with a minor in Mathematics at the College of Staten Island, graduating SpringÂ 2026. As CTO and coâ€‘founder of Dolphin Capital, CSIâ€™s first studentâ€‘run investment fund, I architect our quantitative infrastructure, build Pythonâ€‘based frameworks, and automate backtesting with QuantConnect. On campus, I keep peers and systems connected as an IT Help Desk Analyst, and off campus, I streamline care-team communication as a Patient & Customer Experience Liaison at Northwell Health.

Skilled in Python, C/C++, Django, ML/AI, and other technologies, Iâ€™m passionate about driving impact at the intersection of technology and realâ€‘world challenges. Iâ€™m eager to deepen my consulting, cloud computing, and IT management expertise, working alongside seasoned professionals to deploy scalable, secure solutions.

In the short term, Iâ€™m focused on sharpening my software development and data science skills to become an even more effective collaborator and problem solver. Long term, I aspire to translate that technical foundation into program or product management roles, especially in healthcare or finance, championing innovation that uplifts teams and transforms systems.
