## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm Tharuksha Aaron Don, a Computer Science and Mathematics student passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems that matter.

Iâ€™m Tharuksha Aaron Donâ€”a Computer Science & Math student and **Break Through Tech AI Fellow** through Cornell Techâ€”driven by a passion for using technology to solve problems that matter. As CTO and Co-founder of **Dolphin Capital** at CSI, I lead quant model development and technical operations for our student-run investment fund. I also work part-time as a **Patient & Customer Experience Liaison** at Northwell Health, gaining firsthand insight into healthcare challenges.

My goal is to combine my cross-industry experiences, from finance to healthcare, to build data-driven systems that improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, or tackle whatever the next challenge comes my way. Whether Iâ€™m optimizing code performance, architecting secure full-stack solutions, developing intelligent models, or guiding teams through complex tech hurdles, I thrive at the intersection of technology, innovation, and impact.
